# Restaurant Simulation Project Summary

## 🍽️ Algorithm Analysis and Program Design - Data Structures Group Project 2025

### Project Overview
This C++ program simulates a restaurant setting for a particular day, tracking patrons, waiters, orders, and generating comprehensive reports as required by the assignment. The program demonstrates object-oriented programming principles, modern C++ features, and professional software development practices.

## 📋 Requirements Fulfillment

### Core Requirements (90% of marks)

#### ✅ Report a) Total number of sales divided into sit-in and take-out orders
- **Implementation**: `Restaurant::reportOrderCounts()` method
- **Output**: Displays count of sit-in vs take-out orders
- **Data Structure**: Uses vectors to store and iterate through orders
- **Algorithm**: O(n) time complexity for counting orders by type

#### ✅ Report b) Total sales for the day, divided into sit-in and take-out sales
- **Implementation**: `Restaurant::reportTotalSales()` method
- **Output**: Shows monetary totals for each order type
- **Algorithm**: O(n) time complexity for sales calculation
- **Formatting**: Professional currency formatting with proper alignment

#### ✅ Report c) Total sales made by each waiter
- **Implementation**: `Restaurant::reportWaiterSales()` method
- **Output**: Individual waiter performance with order counts and sales totals
- **Data Structure**: Waiter class maintains vector of assigned orders
- **Features**: Sorts waiters by ID for consistent reporting

#### ✅ Report d) Commission for each waiter (15% of their total sales)
- **Implementation**: `Restaurant::reportWaiterCommission()` method
- **Output**: Commission calculations for each waiter
- **Formula**: Commission = Total Sales × 0.15
- **Formatting**: Professional currency formatting with commission calculations

## 🏆 Bonus Features (10% of marks)

- Comprehensive code comments explaining functionality
- Makefile for Unix/Linux compilation
- Batch file for Windows compilation with multiple compiler support
- Professional project structure and organization

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Data Structures Used
1. **Vectors**: Store waiters, orders, and patron lists with O(1) access
2. **Smart Pointers**: Manage object lifetimes and relationships automatically
3. **Enums**: Type-safe order and patron type classification
4. **Strings**: Handle text data efficiently with proper memory management

### Algorithm Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) for report generation where n is the number of orders
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storage of all orders and related data
- **Memory Management**: Automatic with smart pointers, no manual memory management required

### Class Hierarchy and Relationships
```
Restaurant (Main Controller)
├── Manages vector<shared_ptr<Waiter>> waiters
├── Manages vector<shared_ptr<Order>> orders
└── Generates comprehensive reports

Waiter
├── Tracks vector<shared_ptr<Order>> orders
├── Calculates total sales with O(m) complexity
└── Computes commission (15% of total sales)

Order
├── Links to shared_ptr<Patron> patron
├── Links to shared_ptr<Waiter> waiter
└── Contains order details, type, amount, and timestamp

Patron
├── Individual/Group type classification
├── Sit-in/Take-out preference
└── Group size information for group patrons
```
