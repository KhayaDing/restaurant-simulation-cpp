# Restaurant Simulation C++ Program

## 🍽️ Algorithm Analysis and Program Design - Data Structures Group Project 2025

A comprehensive C++ restaurant simulation program that models a real-world restaurant setting for a particular day. The program tracks patrons, waiters, orders, and generates detailed reports on sales and commissions as required by the course assignment.

## 🎯 Key Features

### Core Requirements (90% of marks)
- ✅ **Report a)** Total number of sales divided into sit-in and take-out orders
- ✅ **Report b)** Total sales for the day, divided into sit-in and take-out sales  
- ✅ **Report c)** Total sales made by each waiter
- ✅ **Report d)** Commission for each waiter (15% of their total sales)

### Bonus Features (10% of marks)
- ✅ **Object-Oriented Programming (5%)** - Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism
- ✅ **Extra Mile Features (5%)** - Smart pointers, modern C++, professional formatting

## 🏗️ Technical Highlights

- **Modern C++11**: Smart pointers, range-based loops, enum classes, chrono library
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Clean class hierarchy with proper encapsulation
- **Professional UI**: Interactive menu system with comprehensive reporting
- **Cross-Platform**: Windows and Unix/Linux compatibility
- **South African Context**: Local names, currency (Rands), and realistic pricing
- **Advanced Features**: Timestamp management, time-based filtering, dynamic order creation

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Compile (Windows)
compile.bat

# Compile (Unix/Linux)
make

# Run
./restaurant_simulation  # Unix/Linux
restaurant_simulation.exe  # Windows
```

## 📊 Sample Output

The program generates professional-formatted reports including:
- Order count breakdowns (sit-in vs take-out)
- Sales totals by type with currency formatting
- Individual waiter performance metrics
- Commission calculations with proper formatting
- Detailed order listings with timestamps

## 🎓 Educational Value
